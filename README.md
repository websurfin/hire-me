## Repository structure
This repository contains two main subdirectories:

* `~/latex/`, holding latex files which I use to typeset coverletters and resumes.
    * In `~/coverletter/`, there are two files:

        * `main.tex`, the main latex file utilizing the coverletter class provided by `coverletter.cls`
    * In `~/resume/`, there are three files:
        * `resume.cls`, a class file that I use to define a clean, two column resume format which allows for easy 
            customization and generation of resumes for my job applications.
        * `main.tex`, the main latex file using the resume class provided by `resume.cls`
        * `sidebar.tex`, a supplementary latex file defining information to be placed in the sidebar (i.e. the smaller
            column) of the resume.
        * `main.pdf`, latest version of my resume pdf.
