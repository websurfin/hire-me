    \begin{itemize}
        \item Developed and formalized novel algorithms in the fields of 
            \href{http://eliassi.org/papers/ai-mag-tr08.pdf}{Collective Classification} and 
            \href{https://arxiv.org/ftp/arxiv/papers/1812/1812.08434.pdf}{Graph Neural Networks}.
        \item Applied these algorithms to \href

            {Social Network prediction problems}.
        \item Managed datasets with terabytes worth of data as well as the 
            \href{https://rc.dartmouth.edu/index.php/discovery-overview/}{computation jobs} used to
            process and analyze this data.

    \datedentry{Counter-terrorism Graph Time Series Analysis}{Dartmouth Security and AI Lab}{Oct. 2018 -- March 2021}{}

    \begin{itemize}
        \item Explored prediction problems in a social network styled dataset which included thousands of terrorists and hundreds of 
            terroristic factions as members.
        \item Improved predictive performance by generating novel features based on centrality, flow, and balance metrics.
            \item Primarily using centrality metrics across monthly subnetworks of terrorist factions.
    \end{itemize}
